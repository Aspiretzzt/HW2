Algorithm description: Generally, this code can test whether an integer is a prime number and the prime factors of a nonprime integer. 
This program accept inputs line-by-line until "quit" is typed to quit the program. Each line input should start with "prime" or "factors"
,following an integer in the "long" type range. For the "prime" input starting situation, the output should be true if the typed integer is 
prime number, and false if the typed integer is nonprime numeber. For the "factors" input starting situation, the output should be one line
of all prime factors of the typed integer, in the ascending order.

Self-review: the program should work well with all required inputs in Homework2

Metadata: I spent nearly 3 hours on this program. Bugs are almost all on The recursive primefactor method part. I encountered the situation 
that the primefactor method part always outputs repeated primes after the correct answer, until the recursion is ended.
